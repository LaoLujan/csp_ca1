            <p>Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes (/ˈɡɔɪə/; Spanish: [fɾanˈθisko xoˈse ðe ˈɣoʝa i luˈθjentes]; 30 March
                1746 – 16 April 1828) was a Spanish romantic painter and printmaker. He is considered the most important
                Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.[1] His paintings, drawings, and engravings
                reflected contemporary historical upheavals and influenced important 19th- and 20th-century painters.[2]
                Goya is often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns.[3]</p>

            <p> was born to a middle-class family in 1746, in Fuendetodos in Aragon. He studied painting from age 14
                under José Luzán y Martinez and moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs. He married Josefa
                Bayeu in 1773. Their life was characterised by a series of pregnancies and miscarriages, and only one
                child, a son, survived into adulthood. Goya became a court painter to the Spanish Crown in 1786 and this
                early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and
                Rococo-style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace.</p>

                    In this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is Goya and the second or maternal family name
                    is Lucientes.</i></p>

            <p>Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes (/ˈɡɔɪə/; Spanish: [fɾanˈθisko xoˈse ðe ˈɣoʝa i luˈθjentes]; 30 March
                1746 – 16 April 1828) was a Spanish romantic painter and printmaker. He is considered the most important
                Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.[1] His paintings, drawings, and engravings
                reflected contemporary historical upheavals and influenced important 19th- and 20th-century painters.[2]
                Goya is often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns.[3]</p>

            <p> was born to a middle-class family in 1746, in Fuendetodos in Aragon. He studied painting from age 14
                under José Luzán y Martinez and moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs. He married Josefa
                Bayeu in 1773. Their life was characterised by a series of pregnancies and miscarriages, and only one
                child, a son, survived into adulthood. Goya became a court painter to the Spanish Crown in 1786 and this
                early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and
                Rococo-style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace.</p>

            <p>Francisco Goya was born in Fuendetodos, Aragón, Spain, on 30 March 1746 to José Benito de Goya y Franque and Gracia de Lucientes y Salvador. The family had moved that year from the city of Zaragoza, but there is no record why; likely José was commissioned to work there.[5] They were lower middle-class. José was the son of a notary and of Basque origin, his ancestors being from Zerain,[6] earning his living as a gilder, specialising in religious and decorative craftwork.[7] He oversaw the gilding and most of the ornamentation during the rebuilding of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar (Santa Maria del Pilar), the principal cathedral of Zaragoza. Francisco was their fourth child, following his sister Rita (b. 1737), brother Tomás (b. 1739) (who was to follow in his father's trade) and second sister Jacinta (b. 1743). There were two younger sons, Mariano (b. 1750) and Camilo (b. 1753).[8]</p>

            <p>At age 14 Goya studied under the painter José Luzán, where he copied stamps[which?] for 4 years until he decided to work on his own, as he wrote later on "paint from my invention".[11] He moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs, a popular painter with Spanish royalty. He clashed with his master, and his examinations were unsatisfactory. Goya submitted entries for the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1763 and 1766 but was denied entrance into the academia.[12]</p>
            <p>Rome was then the cultural capital of Europe and held all the prototypes of classical antiquity, while Spain lacked a coherent artistic direction, with all of its significant visual achievements in the past. Having failed to earn a scholarship, Goya relocated at his own expense to Rome in the old tradition of European artists stretching back at least to Albrecht Dürer.[13] He was an unknown at the time and so the records are scant and uncertain. Early biographers have him travelling to Rome with a gang of bullfighters, where he worked as a street acrobat, or for a Russian diplomat, or fell in love with a beautiful young nun whom he plotted to abduct from her convent.[14] It is possible that Goya completed two surviving mythological paintings during the visit, a Sacrifice to Vesta and a Sacrifice to Pan, both dated 1771.[15]</p>
